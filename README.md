# Data-Structures-Homework
Some of the homework assignments for my data structures class. All were written in java, and all run in the terminal (there is no custom UI). The only assignments included are the ones where I was writing a significant amount of code. Assignments where almost all of the code was given to me by my professor have been left out.

Assignments in specific assignment folders require .txt files to run. In these cases, the block comment contains specific instructions for running the file. Note that the .txt files were given to me by my professor, and that the method for running these files was part of the assignment criteria.
