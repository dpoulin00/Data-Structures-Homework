# Data-Structures-Homework
Some of the homework assignments for my data structures class. All were written in java, and all run in the terminal (there is no custom UI). The only assignments included are the ones where I was writing a significant amount of code. Assignments where almost all of the code was given to me by my professor have been left out.
